# Keras-text-generator-

This project involved finding the optimum settings/architecture for a neural network to perform shakespearan text generation. I tuned the parameters of https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn and compared it's results with my own homebrew neural network. 

I did this using jupyter notebook on my laptop and the project also involved creation of a GUI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=943J1jRh9mk once the weghts were set.
